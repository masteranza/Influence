Influence
=========
App for logging everything and deducing how those things influence one another.

Another iPhone task logging app?
-------------

In some sens, yes.

My ambition is to create an app that will store your food intake, coffee habits, moods etc. in a very simple way.

Direction this is heading
-------------

My goal is to build an app that will at least log information from any iOS device.
I realize that doing analysis will be a much more difficult task; that on the begining will take place solely on the computer. 
Once I develop (or find) working methods to get the desired results I'll try to incorporate them into the app.

Upcoming Features
-------------

So here comes a long list of features that I'd love to implement someday. They are written in order of importance. If you find any particular topic interesting from coding perspective - contact me.

* Predefined Events
* Logging data with optional notes and at any time
* Logging at different specifity level (Food -> Burger -> Chicken Burger)
* Hold to set preset value
* Pinned frequently used events with reversed captioning
* Plugins for tracking weather, pollution, location, sleep etc.
* iCloud sync
* History view with charts
* Analysis of correlations and influences, potentially deducing causes
* Importing data from different services (like Quantified Mind)
* Global analysis (based on data from users around the world)
* Speed combo logging
