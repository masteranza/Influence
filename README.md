Influence
=========
App for logging everything and deducing how those things influence one another.

Another iPhone task logging app?
-------------

In some sens, yes.

My ambition is to create an app that will store your food intake, coffee habits, moods etc. in a very simple way.

Direction this is heading
-------------

My goal is to build an app that will at least log information from any iOS device.
I realize that doing analysis will be a much more difficult task; that on the begining will take place solely on the computer. 
Once I develop (or find) working methods to get the desired results I'll try to incorporate them into the app.
